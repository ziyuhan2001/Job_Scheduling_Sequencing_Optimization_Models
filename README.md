# Supporting and Optimizing the Canam Steel Corporation Steel Joist Production Scheduling System

## Introduction

### Background and Motivation
Canam Steel Corporation (CSC) specializes in the design and fabrication of custom, made-toorder steel joists. CSC, owned by American Industrial Partners (AIP), operates in the steel manufacturing industry. As a major competitor within the industry, it is imperative for CSC to optimize job scheduling to capitalize on efficiency gains. Additionally, CSC could benefit from a transition from traditional practices by embracing new paradigms of data collection, storage, and visualization to effectively facilitate all operational procedures. CSC has already initiated considerations for updating its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in the ongoing year to tackle these challenges. Recent fluctuations in job orders have underscored problems resulting from inadequate data visibility and insufficient support for job scheduling.

### Project Objectives
The project’s goal was to support and improve the joist scheduling process. The main deliverable was a robust algorithmic framework for optimizing steel joist production scheduling. The team’s objectives were as follows:
- Enhance the visibility of the overall joist production process and the workstation process path of job orders.
- Evaluate inaccurate job production time calculations and determine the underlying factors contributing to such inaccuracies.
- Understand and validate the current joist scheduling process.
- Develop a robust job scheduling optimization model for scheduling and sequencing job orders.

## Project Deliverables
The project resulted in three key deliverables, focused on supporting and improving the current steel joist scheduling practices. These deliverables include:
- **Routing Dashboard Development**: The first deliverable involved the creation of a Routing Dashboard. This dashboard will serve as a comprehensive tool to visualize and comprehend the production process flow of job requisitions. By providing valuable insights into the workflow, it will support decision-making processes and aid in optimizing the joist scheduling.
- **Time Validation and Analysis**: The second deliverable entailed a thorough examination and comparison of estimated completion time and actual completion time computations. Through this analysis, the team aims to identify patterns and trends that can offer valuable insights into the scheduling process's accuracy and efficiency.
- **Job Scheduling and Sequencing Optimization Algorithm**: The final deliverable focused on developing a robust job scheduling optimization algorithm. The algorithm's primary objective is to maximize tonnage capacity while considering other relevant factors. This optimization will result in more efficient resource allocation and potential for taking on additional work.

Together, these deliverables establish a comprehensive framework for enhancing the current scheduling and estimation processes. By increasing the scheduled output and improving time accuracy, CSC will gain better insight into their operation, and be equipped to drive growth.
